### Payment implementation
The project also includes a payment implementation using the PayPal REST API. This allows users to securely pay for their orders online using their PayPal account or credit/debit card.

The payment functionality is implemented using the com.paypal.sdk library version 1.14.0. This library provides a simple and secure way to integrate PayPal payments into your application.

To use the payment functionality, you will need to create a PayPal developer account and obtain API credentials. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the PayPal developer documentation. Once you have obtained your credentials, you can add them to your application's configuration file and start using the payment functionality.
